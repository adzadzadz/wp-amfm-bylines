# Project Scope: Schema at Scale Setup 2025 Q3

Jun 2, 2025  
Prepared by: [Sarah Johnson](mailto:sarah.johnson@amfmhealthcare.com)

## Overview

Make schema setup that will work at scale. Schema coming in from byline module is already present and works great. This will be in addition to the existing schema from the byline module.

## Goals

* Improve schema markup around the sites that will improve visibility in search engines and LLM/AIs  
* Improve EEAT

`ML_JSON = website cached version of json from Website Locations Master Sheet`

## Requirements

* Add ACF Field to hold a custom schema that will be available on every page.  
  * Ideally we want this accessible on the main wp edit page and IF possible the quick edit part of the page  
  * This will get a pile of JSON code  
  * This JSON code may have shortcodes in it to add parts of it that we need to dynamically create and insert (examples below)  
    * Medical Organization \- this will be standard for each brand  
      * Medical Clinic \- this will respect brand AND location filter parameter with matching values to be looped through to produce schema pulled from master location JSON or the filtered JSONs  
      * Ideal shortcode will be something like `{{location}}` with   
        * brand filtering for matches from `{{ML_JSON.(Internal) Shortname}}`  
        * region filtering for matches from `{{ML_JSON.Region}}`  
        * and/or state filtering for matches `{{ML_JSON.State}}`  
      * Values to pull in from master location JSON through loop

```json
.... snipped see example ...
{
         "@type": "MedicalClinic",
          "name": {{ML_JSON.Business name}},
          "address": {
            "@type": "PostalAddress",
            "streetAddress": {{ML_JSON.Street}} {{ML_JSON.Unit}},
            "addressLocality": {{ML_JSON.City}},
            "addressRegion": {{ML_JSON.State}},
            "postalCode": {{ML_JSON.Zipcode}},
            "telephone": {{ML_JSON.GMB_Phone}},
            "contactType": "customer service",
            "addressCountry": "US"
          }
        },
.... snipped ...

```

    * Breadcrumbs \- same as whats being added for bylines but ONLY that specific part

### Process to add schema to front end of websites

* If Custom Schema ACF Field has custom schema  
  * Evaluate custom schema field for any shortcode  
  * If shortcode parse appropriate schema by   
    * using the master location JSON to build medical organization and medical clinic setup  
      * Needs to respect a shortcode parameter of region or state   
    * Using breadcrumbs setup same as what the byline module schema is building for its main page type  
  * Add this schema setup to the schema produced by byline module and push to front end of website  
* Else push ONLY schema produced by byline module
